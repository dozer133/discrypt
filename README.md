# Discrypt 2.0

Encrypts and decrypts Discord messages using sharable keys.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you use Discrypt within your own channel/servers.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to setup Discrypt

* A Discord Account
* Firefox or Chrome
* The ability to install addons

### Installing

Install Discrypt couldn't be simpler. Download the addon via the [Firefox Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/discrypt/) or [Chrome Store](#) **coming soon** then open [discord](https://discordapp.com) via the web *not the desktop client* 

## Setting up in your server

Choose a channel where you want Discrypt to work in. We suggest creating a seperate channel for Discrypt convos as it can be rather messy for those without Discrypt for example:
![GodMessyDiscrypt](https://s17.postimg.org/445756ny7/Screenshot_143.png)

In order to set up the key in the server type `.createkey` **It will appear like nothing happens, it's created the key. DO NOT retype .createkey unless you want a new key** 

Now when you type it will encrypt your message, you can tell it's done this by the `[E]` in front of the message. In order to type in Plain Text, use the command `.pt` before your message and it will post your message without encryption.

### Joining a Discrypt Channel

Joining is simple too. Type `.requestkey` and wait to be invited in. Someone who already has the key can type the command that on screen which will be `.sendkey (users public key)` that allows your client to decrypt the messages. 

### Deleting Discrypt from a Channel

`.removekey` **Warning this will cause the current key to be deleted from your client, this means you'll have to request the key again**
